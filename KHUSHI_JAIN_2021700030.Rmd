This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
#start

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

**Questions Answered:**

-   How have the number of total cases and total arrests changed over the years?

-   Are there any noticeable trends or patterns in the total number of cases and arrests?

**Observations:**

-   There is a significant decline in the total number of cases over time.

-   The number of arrests has shown a more consistent decrease, indicating that while fewer cases are being reported, the rate of arrests is not declining as sharply.

```

**Questions Answered:**

-   What is the relationship between the number of cases and the number of arrests for the top 5 crimes?

-   Are there any patterns in how arrests correspond to the number of cases for different crime types?

**Observations:**

-   There is a general trend where the number of arrests increases with the number of cases for most crime types.

-   Narcotics shows the strongest correlation, with a notable increase in arrests corresponding to a higher number of cases.

-   Other crime types also exhibit an increase in arrests with more cases, but the correlation is less pronounced compared to narcotics.

# Summarize the data by year and crime type
summary_data <- filtered_data %>%

```

**Questions Answered:**

-   What is the relationship between the number of cases and the number of arrests for different crime types over the years?

**Observations:**

-   Bubble Size reflects the number of arrests. Larger bubbles indicate a higher number of arrests.

-   Color Coding allows comparison of different crime types and their trends.

-   Narcotics shows consistently larger bubbles and a significant drop in the number of cases over the years.
